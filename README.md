## WYSIWYG

Several information about what is a WYSIWSG.

**Definition :**

a WYSIWSG (=What you see in what you get) is a text preview interface.
It permits to the user to see at the same time that he writes, he modifies and the result obtained as it will publish (same parameters, same size, colours, ...) Its benefits because you don't need to know HTML language for example for a web page. This is the software/application which translates the code on the right commands and parameters.
